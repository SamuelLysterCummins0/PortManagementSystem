# Port Shipping System

## Overview
This project is a port management system where users can create ports, add containerships, load containers and pallets, and manage the transport of goods between ports. The system uses a linked list to organize and track the ports, ships, containers, and pallets.

## Features
- Create multiple ports.
- Add containerships to ports.
- Load containers onto ships and pallets into containers.
- Manage port controls: send ships to sea, dock them in other ports, and unload containers and pallets.

## How to Use
1. Create a port and add containerships.
2. Load containers onto the ships and add pallets to the containers.
3. Use the port controls to send ships to other ports.
4. Dock ships in the new port and unload the cargo.

## Running the Project
To run the project, just compile and run `ShippingSystem.java`. This will start everything so you can create ports, add ships, and manage your shipments. **For the best experience, keep the application minimized** so it runs smoothly.
